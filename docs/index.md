# Health Services Platform Marketplace 

The HL7 Health Services Platform Marketplace (HSPM or "Marketplace") is an HL7/Logica Health (formerly HSPC) specification for publication, cataloging, discovering, and deployment of computable healthcare products and executable knowledge.

This site contains the various published versions of the specification. If you're looking for more general information on Marketplace reference _implementations_, you can find those at [Graphite Health](https://www.graphitehealth.io).

Releases of the specification -- not reference implementations -- are formally balloted and published through HL7 exclusively. Likewise, Logica Health and Graphite Health engage in implementation activities but are not standards developing organizations (SDOs).
