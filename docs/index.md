# Health Services Platform Marketplace 

The HL7 Health Services Platform Marketplace ("Marketplace" for short) is an HL7/Logica Health (formerly HSPC) specification for the publication, cataloging, discovering, and deployment of computable healthcare products and executable knowledge.

This site contains the most up to date version of the specification and the formally balloted versions. If you're looking for Marketplace _implementations_, HL7 Implementation Division operates a copy of the [Skycapp](https://www.skycapp.com) platform that maintains compliance with the specification.

Releases of the specification are formally balloted and published through HL7, while software implementations are not. Similarly, implementing organizations are not standards developing organizations (SDOs).
